# stock-analysis

##Overview
The initial task was to provide a summary of the performance of 12 stocks. Using a VBA script, we were able to compile all the data for a given year and provide a simple table that showed the stock ticker symbol, the total volume and percent return for the year. Recognizing that we may want to later expand the dataset, we then refactored the code to try to optimize it's performance.
##Results
The refactored code was able to speed up the calculation process. For both years, the run time was cut nearly in half. Please see the following timer run time message boxes for comparison:
